Additionally, this neighborhood has the biggest population of youth in Manhattan: over 35,000 of its residents are between the ages of 5 and 19 years. This district also has the highest number of teenage mothers in Manhattan. It also falls under the category of Mental Health Care Shortage Areas (MHSAs).\"<br/><br/> There is a rich, multi-ethnic history to this neighborhood, with current socioeconomic demographics largely influenced by white flight and immigration from the Dominican Republic associated with a shift in NYC from an industrial economy to a service economy starting in the 1960s, as well as gentrification throughout the 2000s contributing to \"drastic rent increases\" and \"the highest rate of severe crowding in Manhattan.\""

On one hand, in theory, increased protection of tenants' rights exhibits both non-exclusion (every tenant would benefit) and joint consumption (one tenant's case against a landlord would not affect another tenant's case against their landlord). However, the particular implementation of resources may cause the nature of the good to differ. For example, a Heat Seek sensor is a private good, as it can only be installed in one apartment. Additionally, a backlogged judiciary and inefficient social service system may cause the processing of one tenant's case to directly delay the processing of another tenant's case, resembling a common-pool resource. <br/><br/>The collective action problem, at worst, appears to be the ineffective collaboration of different underfunded resource providers in a system that incentivizes the punting of aggrieved tenants to other organizations in a frustrating game of monkey-in-the-middle. Alternatively, the collective action problem may be framed as transforming the current system such that taking action against a delinquent landlord no longer resembles a common-pool resource, but rather becomes a truly public good by making the system efficient enough that one tenant's case does not slow down another tenant's case. <br/><br/>I theorize that the NYC[x] Inwood Housing Rights Challenge, by incentivizing private sector entities to enter the \"market\" of tenants' rights resources, aimed to introduce more production units into a public economy that had largely relied, almost exclusively, on a handful of public entities. In doing so, I frame the Inwood and Washington Heights community and Northern Manhattan CBOs as collective consumption units, not the local government agencies that serve the community."
