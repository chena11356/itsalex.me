Additionally, this neighborhood has the biggest population of youth in Manhattan: over 35,000 of its residents are between the ages of 5 and 19 years. This district also has the highest number of teenage mothers in Manhattan. It also falls under the category of Mental Health Care Shortage Areas (MHSAs).\"<br/><br/> There is a rich, multi-ethnic history to this neighborhood, with current socioeconomic demographics largely influenced by white flight and immigration from the Dominican Republic associated with a shift in NYC from an industrial economy to a service economy starting in the 1960s, as well as gentrification throughout the 2000s contributing to \"drastic rent increases\" and \"the highest rate of severe crowding in Manhattan.\""
